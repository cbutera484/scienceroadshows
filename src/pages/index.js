		<H3>Science Roadshows</H3>
		<p>
      Live programs presented by teacher Lee Ognibene. (Retired Sayville
      Planetarium Director and 1998 Suffolk County Science Teacher of the Year).
      I wear a theme outfit that fits each show and use a wireless mic with a
      professional sound system for crystal clear sound. My video projector will
      light up your screen with amazing, jaw-dropping video scenes that will
      create the excitement of a live, professional show. Many have said my
      shows are like a mix of Disney, Bill Nye, and an IMAX movie. My shows are
      also very humorous and itâ€™s wonderful to hear both children and their
      parents laughing as they share the wonders of science. I have won many
      awards for my ability to teach and motivate audiences of all ages.
