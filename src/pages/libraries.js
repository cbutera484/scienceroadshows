      I have 4 exciting science shows that would be perfect for your library.
      Each show can be used as a children’s program or a family program for
      children and their parents to enjoy together. My shows consistently get
      rave reviews and have that “wow” factor. After each show, parents and kids
      tell me that my show was the best library program they ever saw! So many
      librarians have written thank you notes that praised my shows. My two most
      popular shows are the The Space Roadshow and The BUG Show, The latter two
      make the best family shows. The other two are Our Endangered Earth and
      Under the Sea. All 4 shows are live programs presented by teacher Lee
      Ognibene. (Retired Sayville Planetarium Director and 1998 Suffolk County
      Science Teacher of the Year). I wear a theme outfit that fits each show
      and use a wireless mic with a professional sound system for crystal clear
      sound. My video projector will light up your screen with amazing,
      jaw-dropping video scenes that will create the excitement of a live,
      professional show. Many have said my shows are like a mix of Disney, Bill
      Nye, and an IMAX movie. My shows are also very humorous and it’s wonderful
      to hear both children and their parents laughing as they share the wonders
      of science. I have won many awards for my ability to teach and motivate
      audiences of all ages. It would be my pleasure to perform my shows at your
      library. Each show is one hour long and is only $275.
